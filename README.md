# Mangadex Reader

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple web application that talks to the Mangadex v5 API (beta), meant to learn more about React and web app development.

## Disclaimer

This is merely a web application that makes API requests to the Mangadex API. The web application does not actually store any of the images, but downloads them from Mangadex's servers.

## Building the App

`npm start` should run a dev build locally.
